Please check the syllabus for late submissions. -->\n","You are expected to write clear, detailed, and complete answers when analysing your data. Lack of this may result in point deductions.\n","\n","**Reminder.** You must submit your own work. The collaboration policy for the assignments is Group Collaboration. You may work together in groups of up to 2.\n"," On Canvas we added a group set called \"Assignment Group\".  We have enabled self-signup for you to signup as a group.  If you don't select your group by Wednesday Sep 25th 11:59pm, we will assume you are working on your own.\n"," Under the group collaboration policy, besides working with your group member, you can discuss concepts with. your peers. However, the work must be by your own group, and all sources of information used including books, websites, students you talked to, must be cited in the submission. Please see the course FAQ document for details on this collaboration policy. We will adhere to current Faculty of Science guidelines on dealing with suspected cases of violation of academic integrity.\n","\n","You must use this notebook to complete your assignment. You will execute the questions in the notebook. The questions might ask for a short answer in text form or for you to write and execute a piece of code. **Make sure you enter your answer in either case only in the cell provided.**  Do not use a different cell and do not create a new cell. Do not delete any test cells.  Creating new cells for your code and deleting test cells is not compatible with the auto-grading system we are using and thus your assignment will not be graded properly and you will lose marks for that question.\n","\n","Your submitted notebook should run on our local installation.  So if you are importing packages not listed in the notebook or using local data files not included in the assignment package, make sure the notebook is self-contained with a requirements.txt file or cells in the notebook itself to install the extra packages.  If we cannot run your notebook, you will lose 50% of the marks, and any additional marks that may be lost due to wrong answers.\n","\n","### Submission Instructions\n","When you are done, you will submit your work from the notebook. Make sure to save your notebook before running it, and then submit on Canvas the notebook file with your work completed.\n","\n","**IMPORTANT: Name your file with your *Student ID number* and the assignment number (ex: 1234567_A1.ipynb).
